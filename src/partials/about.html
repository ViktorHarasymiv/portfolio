      <!-- Hello! I`m a FrontEnd developer from Dnipro, Ukraine, and my passion is
      turning dreams into reality with code. If websites could talk, they would
      probably thank me for making them so alive and interactive! I like to work
      on every pixel, creating from simple but elegant pages to such complicated
      labyrinths that Chuck Norris himself would have to use a navigator. I
      finished GoIT courses and now I know the magic of Full Stack Development.
      My secret ingredient? HTML5/CSS3, JavaScript, React, Redux, Node.js,
      MongoDB and more. I know how to tame responsive design so that it works on
      any device, and I know exactly how to liven up your site with light
      animations. My motto: Each project should be better than the previous one!
      And I`m always looking for new challenges and interesting opportunities so
      that your project doesn`t just exist on the Internet, but lives its own
      unique life. -->

      is to become a Junior Front-End Developer, where my critical thinking,
      curiosity and positive work attitude will lead to successful projects. I
